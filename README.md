## Nateve

Nateve is a new general domain programming language open source inspired by languages like Python, C++, JavaScript, and Wolfram Mathematica.

Nateve is an transpiled language. Its first transpiler, Adam, is fully built using Python 3.8.

## Nateve principal features

### 1. Simple and easy to use

Just install the package and start coding.

### 2. Intuitive and easy to understand

Quickly understand the language and its features.

### 3. 100% free and open source

The language is free and open source. You can use it for any purpose. See the [license](LICENSE).

### 4. 100% customizable

You can customize the language to your needs. You can make your own language from scratch. See the [Welcome to Nateve templates](#welcome-to-nateve-templates) section for more information.

## Welcome to Nateve templates

Nateve Language includes a set of templates that can be used to customize Nateve. Templates are Python modules included in the templates subpackage. You can also create your own templates.

A template is a Python module that contains a set of words translations, functions definitions, and many other customizations. Every template can be used to customize Nateve. You just need to import the template with the `using` command and then use the template in the Nateve source code.

Learn more about templates in the [templates use](#using-templates) section.

## Why use Nateve templates?

### 1. Customization

You can customize the language to your needs. Feel free to create your own templates or modify existing templates.

### 2. Team work

Your team can work together using different languages in the same file or project. For example, you can start coding in English and then switch to French.

It makes it easier to work together. Different team members can work on the same project using their native languages.

### 3. Easy to share

Your templates can be used by other developers. You can easily share your templates with the community.

## Options of command line

1. `build`: Transpile Nateve source code to Python 3.8
2. `run`: Run Nateve source code
3. `transpile`: Transpile Nateve source code to an executable file (.exe)
4. `run-init-loop`: Run Nateve source code with an initial source and a loop source
5. `set-time-unit`: Set Adam time unit to seconds or miliseconds (default: milisecond)
6. `-v`: Activate verbose mode

## Nateve Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Nateve step by step.

### Step 0: Learn the basics

We recommend read this README.md file.

### Step 1: Installation

Recommend Installation:

#### Clone the repo

```bash
$> git clone ...
```

#### Add to path

#### Add your favorite templates

### Step 2: Create a new Nateve file

```bash
$> cd my-project
$> COPY CON main.nate
```

### Quick start examples

#### Hello World program

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### Is prime? program

```python
def is_prime(n) {
    if n == 1 {
        return False
    }
    for i in range(2, n) {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return False
        }
    }
    return True
}

n = ninput("Enter a number: ")

if is_prime(n) {
    print("It is a prime number.")
}
else {
    print("It is not a prime number.")
}
```

### Comments

If you want to comment your code, you can use:

```bash
~ This is a single line comment ~

~
    And this a multiline comment
~
```

### Variables

This language uses variables. For declaring variables, you just need to write the name of the variable and the value of the variable.

For example:

```python
a = 1                          ~ Interger ~
b = 1.0                        ~ Float ~
c = 1 + 2j                     ~ Complex ~
d = "hello"                    ~ String ~
e = True                       ~ Boolean ~
f = [1,2,3]                    ~ Vector ~
g = (1,2)                      ~ Tuple ~
h = Polynomial("1 +2x +x^2")   ~ Polynomial ~
i = $
| 1 1 2 3 4 |
| 0 1 2 3 4 |
| 1 1 2 3 4 |
| 1 1 2 3 4 |
| 1 1 2 3 4 |
$                              ~ Matrix ~
```

Nateve allows data type as Integer, Float, Complex, Boolean, String, Tuple, None, Vector, Polynomial and Matrix.

### Vectors

The Vectors allow to use all the data types before mentioned, as well as lists and functions.

Also, they allow to get an item through the next notation:

```python
value_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
value_list2 = [0,1,0,1,0]

print(value_list[0])                ~ Output: 1 ~
print(value_list[0 : 4])            ~ Output: [1 2 3 4] ~

print(value_list.dot(value_list2))  ~ Output: 6 ~

print(value_list.add(value_list2))  ~ Output: [1 3 3 5 5] ~
```

### Matrices

The Matrices are a special type of vectors of vectors.

```python
a = $
| 1 5 |
| 0 2 |
$

b = $
|0 1|
|1 0|
$

print(a)
~ Output:
| 1 5 |
| 0 2 |
~

c = a.dot(b)
print(c)
~ Output:
| 5 1 |
| 2 0 |
~

d = a.plus(b)
print(d)
~ Output:
| 1 6 |
| 1 2 |
~
```

### Functions

For declaring a function, you have to use the next syntax:

```python
def example_function(argument1, argument2, ...) {
    ~ sentence1 ~
    ~ sentence2 ~
    ...
    return Return_Value
} 

example_function(argument1, argument2, ...) ~ Call the function ~
```

### Conditionals

Regarding the conditionals, the syntax structure is:

```python
if condition {
    ~ consequence ~
}
elif condition {
    ~ other_consequence ~
}
...
else {
    ~  default_consequence ~
}
```

For example:

```python
if x <= 1 and x % 3 == 0 {
    a = 0
}
elif x == 9 {
    a = 1
}
else {
    a = 2
}
```

### Loops

In order to use loops, you have to use the next syntax:

#### While Loop

```python
while condition {
    ~ sentence1 ~
    ~ sentence2 ~
    ...
}  
```

#### For Loop

```python
for iterator in iterable {
    ~ sentence1 ~
    ~ sentence2 ~
    ...
}  
```

## Using Templates

One of the most important features of Nateve is the use of templates. Templates are a way to write code in a more readable way. They are words translations written in Python. In order to use templates, you just have to write the protected word "using", and then, write the name of the template. For example:

```c++
using "template_name"
```

Nateve includes the following standard templates:

1. `"english"`: This template is used to write the code of the program in English. It is the default template.
2. `"spanish"`: This template is used to write the code of the program in Spanish.
3. `"french"`: This template is used to write the code of the program in French.

You also can use your own templates. Just create a file with the name of the template and write the code of the template in the file. Here is a blank template:

```python
# The name of the transpiler. This line is required. Do not change it.
transpiler_name = "adam"

"""
The following code is the translation of the code.
You can write your code here and modify the content of the variables.
Do not change the name of the variables.
"""

# All the symbols that the transpiler uses.
mayusc = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
alphabet = mayusc + mayusc.lower() + "_"
digits = "0123456789"
alphanum = alphabet + digits
blanks = "/t /n"
strings = ["'", '"', '"""', "'''"]
matrices = "$"
vectors = "[]"
embedded = "Â°"
commentaries = "~"
floating = "."
one_char_symbols = "+-*/%=<>()[]{}#@,."
two_char_symbols = ["//", "==", "<=", ">="]

# All the data types that the transpiler uses.
FLOAT = "float"
INT = "int"
COMPLEX = "complex"
STRING = "string"
DOCSTRING = "docstring"
NULL = "none"
MATRIX = "matrix"
VECTOR = "vector"

# All the keywords that the transpiler uses.
USE, INCLUDE = "using", "include"
IMPORT, FROM, AS, PASS, IN = "import", "from", "as", "pass", "in"
IF, ELIF, ELSE = "if", "elif", "else"
TRY, EXCEPT, WITH = "try", "except", "with"
WHILE, FOR, BREAK, CONTINUE = "while", "for", "break", "continue"
OPERATOR, RETURN = "def", "return"
CLASS, SELF = "class", "self"
AND, OR, NOT, TRUE, FALSE = "and", "or", "not", "True", "False"

# All the status codes that the transpiler uses.
embedding = 200
identifier = 300
eof = 400

# All extra functions that the transpiler uses. Feel free to add your own functions.
# The string special_functions is used to write these functions.
# You can use variables in it using the fstring notation.
special_functions = f"""
def ninput(prompt = '', default = ''):
    return float(input(prompt, default))

def binput(prompt = '', default = ''):
    return bool(input(prompt, default))

def update_std():
    subprocess.call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', 'eggdriver'])
"""
```
